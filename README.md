This project implements Artistic Style Transfer using neural networks. The system allows users to blend the content of one image with the style of another, generating beautiful, stylized outputs. It leverages a pre-trained deep learning model to perform style transfer efficiently on images, and can be extended to other applications like videos.
Features

->Select a content image and a style image.

->Generate a new image that combines the content of the first image with the style of the second.

->Support for high-resolution image outputs.

->Real-time image capture for content images.

->Option to download the generated image.
